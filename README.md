# python_party_summer_2025
## Overview 
This repository contains my solutions to the Python Summer Party Challenge,
a free 15-day data-focused Python challenge for data analysts and data scientists.

Over 3,000+ people are participating in this global challenge and
each day brings a new real world business problem to solve utilizing
my data analytics expertise.

## My Approach
While the challenge only focuses on solving the problem and getting a
result, I am expanding upon the challenge by:

### 1. Providing Business Insights
  After solving each problem, I write 1-2 recommendations based on the insight
  the problem's solution provides. The insights are written with stakeholders
  and those working at the company in mind.
  
### 2. Preparing For The Workplace
  By ensuring my code is well commented and explainable to others, I am practicing
  for live, technical interviews and working with other data analysts by keeping my
  work clear and organized. This also allows me to practice combining technical and
  business concepts in a business friendly way, which is a key skill for analysts.

## My Tech Stack
Python (pandas, NumPy)
Jupyter Notebook (for code display & business insights)

## Why This Matters
InterviewMaster (the site hosting the challenge) is intended for data 
analytics interview practice. While the questions are intended for only
coding practice, I am going above and beyond to explain my coding process
and provide my data driven recommendations as if I was actually working
in a data role.
